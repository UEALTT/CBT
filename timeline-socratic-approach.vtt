00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:13.280
If you had been asked, if somebody
had said to you, your husband is going to die

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.330
quite suddenly right, how do you,
and someone had said that to you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.859
how would you have predicted you'd have coped? Wouldn't have wanted to go on living

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.720
really. Right so when we look at that
and we look at what you actually did,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.550
what did you actually do? I went on
living didn't I.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.500
So what does that tell you about
yourself?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.280
If I've got to do something I'll do it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.280
I've got to do it I had to do it and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.360
this is a little bit provocative, how
much of a fall apart person are you?
